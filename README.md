# ZealandDimselab
Exam Project for 2. semester created by [Steven Pedersen], [Christoper Jepsen], [Mikkel Meiling], [Oscar Hemmingsen].
I've forked the project, since I am learning about dependency injection and appsettings.
therefor I wanna  refactor the existing code to levage dependency injection better, and include appsettings.json where it is needed.

The project was original intended to be implemented at our school Zealand Business College in Roskilde.
However due to our teacher getting a new offer at a school, the plans felt apart.
